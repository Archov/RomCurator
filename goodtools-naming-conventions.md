## Good codes

The following are codes and naming schemes given to the majority (some system specific) ROM image sets for various home computer and video game consoles. Please note that some codes (such as the Sega Genesis country codes) are only on old GoodTools versions and only remain for reference.

### Standard codes

| [a]   | Alternate          | This is simply an alternate version of a ROM. Many games have been re-released to fix bugs or even to eliminate Game Genie codes (Yes, Nintendo hates that device). |
| ----- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [b]   | Bad Dump           | A bad dump often occurs with an older game or a faulty dumper (bad connection). Another common source of [b] ROMs is a corrupted upload to a release FTP. |
| [f]   | Fixed              | A fixed game has been altered in some way so that it will run better on a copier or emulator. |
| [h]   | Hack               | Something in this ROM is not quite as it should be. Often a hacked ROM simply has a changed header or has been enabled to run in different regions. Other times it could be a release group intro, or just some kind of cheating or funny hack. |
| [o]   | Overdump           | An overdumped ROM image has more data than is actually in the cart. The extra information means nothing and is removed from the true image. |
| [p]   | Pirate             |                                                              |
| [t]   | Trained            | A trainer is special code which executes before the game is begun. It allows you to access cheats from a menu. |
| [T-]  | OldTranslation     |                                                              |
| [T+]  | NewerTranslation   |                                                              |
| [!]   | Verified Good Dump | Verified good dump. Thank God for these!                     |
| [!p]  | Pending Dump       |                                                              |
| (M#)  | Multilanguage      | # of Languages                                               |
| (###) | Checksum           |                                                              |
| (??k) | ROM Size           |                                                              |
| (Unl) | Unlicensed         |                                                              |
